This is a new installment in which I attempt to visualize Moroccan diplomatic networks during the reign of Muhammad III (1757-1790) through a network analysis of their correspondence. Using official letters collected from archives across the Mediterranean, this network analysis not only demonstrates the breadth and intensity of Moroccan diplomatic relations during the eighteenth century, but also seeks to reframe how we understand the internal mechanisms of Morocco's diplomatic system. (A more detailed version of this is presented in my dissertation, "Divinely Guided Ambassadors: Ottoman and Moroccan Roots of Modern Diplomacy in the Eighteenth Century Mediterranean")

This first iteration focuses on the Moroccan sultan himself, Muhammad III. Histories of eighteenth century Morocco often cite Muhammad III as one of the most influential characters in the creation of modern Morocco. He is noted both for unifying the country by quelling internal rebellions as well as opening up Morocco to an international trade and treaty system. Under his reign Morocco signed commercial and peace treaties with at least twelve countries across Europe as well as the nascient United States of America. He also is credited with planning and building the Atlantic port of Essaouira. In many respects, these aspects of his reign have centered all studies on Moroccan diplomacy around the sultan. But what did Moroccan diplomacy actually look like in the eighteenth century?

The figure above represents all of the Moroccan diplomatic actors who wrote official diplomatic correspondence with foreign counterparts during the reign of Muhammad III. These Moroccan actors are labeled in 'Red'. Actors from other countries are labeled in the various colors. For instance, Spanish actors are marked in Tourquoise, French in Pink, British in Blue, Portuguese in Green, and Ragusans in Purple. 

Furthermore,the size of each node is dictated by how many official diplomatic letters that Moroccan actor sent. In other words, the larger the node the more official diplomatic letters that person sent. If we zoom in on the larger map, a few things become clear:

Here we get a better understanding of the relative size of the diplomatic nodes as well as the names of the individuals attached to each.
