The inaugural [**SNAP Bulletin**](http://www.spainnorthafricaproject.org/bulleltin) treats the complex entanglements of the relationship between Spain and North Africa. This issue focuses on the shift from the early modern to the modern and its consequences for both Moroccan and Spanish actors in the western Mediterranean. From an eighteenth century ambassadorial mission to the twentieth century establishment of Tetouan’s Centro de Arte Moderno, Eric Calderwood’s description of the two as ‘strange bedfellows’ is ever present in the background. The blog begins with a Story Map about [**al-Miknasi's 1779 Mission**](http://spainnorthafricaproject.squarespace.com/story-maps/al-miknasi). A special thanks also goes out to our first contributors: [**Tina Barouti**](http://www.spainnorthafricaproject.org/bulleltin/2019/7/8/arts-feature-our-dream-was-to-rescue), [**Liz Matsushita, Eric Calderwood**](http://www.spainnorthafricaproject.org/bulleltin/2019/7/7/inaugural-snap-bulletin-summer-2019), and [**Linda Gale-Jones**](http://www.spainnorthafricaproject.org/bulleltin/2019/7/8/grant-updates). Enjoy!
